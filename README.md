## Pictue of the circo plot of Bretziella fagacearum
![Circo plot](https://github.com/mohitmahey/Bretziella_fagacearum_genome_circo/blob/main/circos.png)
the circo plot shows from outermost to innermost ring a) the length( MB) of the  chromosomes labeled one through nine. b) GC-content distribution with High GC(blue) and Low GC(yellow) regions. c) gene density of number of genes per 10kb of genomic region(0 - 0.006). d) position of genes across the whole genome.

## getting data files
For the tracks data, genome file and gff was used. For the circo data, the input files are tab delimited files.

### 1. karyotype -  size of the chromosomes

To get the size of the chromosomes, SAMtools was used.
This command give general inforamtion about the genome including size.
```
samtools faidx Brefa1_AssemblyScaffolds.fasta
```
To only get the length of the chromosomes 

```
cut -f1,2 Brefa1_AssemblyScaffolds.fasta.fai > scaffold_sizes.txt
```

### 2. GC-content across genome

To get GC content per 10000bp of genome, we can use bedtools nuc function
First we will need .bed file with partion of the genome into 10000bp chunks. this will be used as reference bed for nuc function

to get genomic_regions.bed file we can use makewindows function of bedtools
```
bedtools makewindows -g scaffold_sizes.txt -w 10000 > genomic_regions.bed
```

nuc provides GC content and other stats as different columms, which was removed in excel later
```
bedtools nuc -fi Brefa1_AssemblyScaffolds.fasta -bed genomic_regions.bed > gc_content
```

### 3. Gene-density plot 
gene density is calculated as number of predicted genes per 10000bp

first all gff file was parsed for genes using awk to get a gff file with only genes positions
```
awk '$3 == "gene"' Brefa1_GeneCatalog_20200715.gff3 > output_genes.gff3
```

to count the number of genes per 10000 bp, we gonna utilise intersect function
```
bedtools intersect -a genomic_regions.bed -b output_genes.gff3 -c > gene_counts_per_region.bed
```
to calulate density we are gonna utilise awk 

```
awk '{print $0, $NF/1000}' gene_counts_per_region.bed > gene_density_per_region.bed
```
gene_density_per_region.bed file was renamed and saved as gene_density.txt 

### 4. gene locations 
The tile grpah shows the position of the genes acorss the genome
The gene position was caluated from gff3 files

the gff file was parsed with awk to only get info of genes
```
awk '$3 == "gene"' Brefa1_GeneCatalog_20200715.gff3 > output_genes.gff3
```
gff2bed function of bedtops toolkit was used to convert the output_genes.gff3 to output_genes.bed
using excel only first 3 columns was kept and saved to be used to plot the track as gene_position.txt
